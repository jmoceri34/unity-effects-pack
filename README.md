* Changing color of a game object over time using a curve to determine strength of movement.</li>
* Moving objects on automated tracks (you can modify your inputs on the fly, the effects will apply the new modifications)</li>
* Changing the alpha of a game object over time using a curve to determine strength for how to adjust it.</li>
