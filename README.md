## Overview
Unity Effects Pack is an asset (.unitypackage) for Unity 2020+. It contains a series of effects that are prepended by AP such as APMove, APColor, etc. You can add these components to game objects and use them to apply things such as
  
* Color: When applied to a game object, this could change the color in all sorts of ways, with as many colors as you'd like. Options to randomize and adjust alpha.
* Move: When applied to a game object, would allow you to move to a position. You could move there via 3 options: Linear, Circular, Sine. This was great for all sorts of UI effects. It also applied to 3D game objects too.
* Rotate: When applied to a game object, would allow all sorts of rotations.
* Scale: When applied to a game object, would enable scaling.
* Squash&Stretch: When applied to a game object, would allow the principle of design Squash and Stretch; create's really cool effects on 3D models.
  
These effects use a curve to determine strength and other properties to adjust the effect.
